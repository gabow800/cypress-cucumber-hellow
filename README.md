# Cypress and cucumber

This is an example of how to integrate Cypress with Cucumber using the [cypress-cucumber-preprocessor](https://github.com/badeball/cypress-cucumber-preprocessor) 
plugin.

With this setup you can write your test cases with Gherkin syntax and run them with Cypress.

# Get started

Install Cypress
Run the tests
```bash
cypress run
```

# Notes
- The test with Gherkin syntax is located in [cypress/integration/Google.feature](cypress/integration/Google.feature)
- The implementation of the test is located in [cypress/integration/Google/google.js](cypress/integration/Google/google.js)
